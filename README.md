# **Real Estate Blockchain (Logement Blockchain System)**

## **Project Overview**

### Context & Objectives

A blockchain-based platform for secure and transparent housing validation, designed to prevent rental fraud and ensure trusted logement transactions using Proof of Authority consensus. Ideal for managing verified housing listings during large events like the 2030 World Cup in Morocco.

This project implements a secure blockchain system for managing real estate transactions. Key capabilities include:

- **Immutable Ledger**: Tamper-proof transaction history
    
- **Flexible Consensus**: Supports both Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Authority (PoA)
    
- **Digital Notarization**: RSA signatures for transaction validation
    
- **Transaction Types**: Ownership transfers, rental agreements, and property registration
    
### Technical Implementation

We've built the following core components:

|Component|Key Features|
|---|---|
|`KeyManager`|RSA key generation (2048-bit), fingerprinting, secure storage|
|`SignatureManager`|Digital signing/verification with RSASSA-PSS|
|`Block`|Custom blockchain structure with PoA/PoW support|
|`Blockchain`|Mining, validation, transaction queries, chain persistence|
|`Consensus`|Extensible consensus layer (PoA implemented)|

## **Demonstration Features**

- PoW mining with housing transactions
    
- PoA validation with authorized signers
    
- Chain persistence (JSON import/export)
    
- Transaction querying capabilities

## **Current Implementation Status**
